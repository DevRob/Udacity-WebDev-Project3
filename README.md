frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

loading the index.html will start the game immediately.

Use arrows to move the player(boy) around grass and stone tiles.

The goal is to reach the key on the other side of the map without hitting the vehicles(bugs). You have 3 lives before the game restart and load the 1st level.

There are gems on the stone tiles you can collect for extra points(150 each), also completing a level gives you 300 points.

After the last level you find yourself on an island with your reward. You can restart the game to move the player in the middle of the island.
